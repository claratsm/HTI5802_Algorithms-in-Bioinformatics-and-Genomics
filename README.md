### Welcome

Welcome to the github site for practical sections of HTI5802: Algorithms in Bioinformatics and Genomics. Most contents are demonstrated with PLINK and R programming language.

This site is designed as a collection of R Markdown notebooks, as supplementary to the lecture notes for the courses of GWAS and sequence interpretation of HTI5802 at PolyU.

1. [Genomewide association analysis (GWAS)](https://github.com/claratsm/HTI5802_Algorithms-in-Bioinformatics-and-Genomics/blob/main/GWAS.md) (2025-02-17)
2. [Variant interpretation for clinical sequencing]() (2025-03-10)

Note: Most contents may be updated before or right after the lectures, so please refer to the updated version.
